                    <p className="card-text">Hey everyone! This is Vinh Mao, and I am pretty excited to introduce myself! I was born and raised in Seattle, WA, and have lived here ever since. I graduated from the University of Washington with a mathematics degree back in 2016, but before I went to Washington Middle School and Garfield High School. I enjoy running or jogging, Sudoku puzzles, video games (especially rhythm games), and scratchboard art during my free time. Walking around parks is something I enjoy doing as well, even if there is no end destination.</p>
                    <p>I speak from experience when I say that nothing is ever as bad as it seems, no matter how you think of it, and that is something I live by every day. No matter how pessimistic I may be or hopeless things feel, things really do get better and youâ€™ll always be left wondering why you even spent so much time pondering over any situation. With that in mind, I look forward to spending time loving myself, while at the same time acknowledging that bad things happen and still weather through it.</p>
